    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <p>
        The problem statement we are trying to solve is detecting traffic lanes in real-time. With cars being 
        driven every day and engineers trying to make cars safer, many companies are turning to machine 
        learning and self-driving in order to help solve this problem. 
    </p>
    <p>
        This is an essential problem in the real world as there are an increasing number of cars with built-in 
        technologies to do this. For example, Tesla has self-driving cars, and many other big-name automotive 
        companies have technologies such as lane assist, ensuring that the driver is driving in the correct 
        lane and direction. However, this technology is still very new and has many problems. For example, 
        how can the computer detect a lane in poor weather conditions or a faded-out lane? What if there are 
        no street lights at night that prevent the computer from detecting any lanes? What about the effects 
        of lane-like objects on the road such as railways and walkways? These variables affect every driver 
        and can affect traffic lane detection as well. While existing algorithms can have a very high 
        detection rate, generally most of these tests are done using favorable conditions such as a clear 
        road and good lighting (Huang et. al, 2021). 
    </p>

    <h2>Importance of Lane Detection</h2>
    <p>
        Self driving cars and lane detection have the potential to make the world safer. For example, according
        to the article “Drowsy driving statistics and facts 2022” by Elizabeth Rivelli, there have 
        been over 10,000 fatal crashes due to drowsy or careless driving, including failure to keep in the 
        proper lane, being distracted (by phone, talking eating, etc), and swerving due to weather, objects, 
        etc. These serious fatalities could be easily avoided by equipping programs in modern cars with good 
        traffic lane detections that can account for any, or at least most, situations (Rivelli, 2022).
    </p>

    <h2>Motivation / Usage (Potentially Remove?)</h2>
    <p>
    </p>
  
    <h2>Current State of Art</h2>
    <p>
        <a herf="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4580573">Article</a>
        Many researchers has created high level road lane detection to account for any conditions, 
        starting with a simple similar approch as ours, and adding more layed techniques to create effective algorithms.
        For example, "Read time lane dection for autonomous vehicles" by some professors from International 
        Islamic University Malaysia.
    </p>
  
    <h2>Dataset</h2>
    <p>
        In order to better grasp the underlying image processing techniques used in lane detection, we opted to use clean and well lit images and video from the
        <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/soumya044/lane-line-detection/">Lane Line Detection</a>.
        Furthermore, in order to further evaluate the strengths and drawbacks of our model, we then decided to use some images from the 
        <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jasonyuan000/unet-lanes-v3">UNet Lanes v3</a> dataset in 
        Kaggle. This is a fairly large and robust dataset containing road lane images from simulators to varying real world conditions.
    </p>

    <h2>Proposed Solution</h2>
    <p>
      Our proposed solution is an algorithm that, given static images or even a video of a car driving on the road, will detect and highlight lanes in real-time. This will done through the image processing techniques learned from class. This approach forms the foundation of many of the state of the art advanced techniques that are currently being implemented in industry and academia.
    </p>

    <h2>Method</h2>
    <p>
      For this project we used python and openCV in order to process an image i.e. a frame. 
    </p>
    <ol>
      <h3><li>Applying Canny Edge Detection</li></h3>
      <p>The intuitive step for lane detection is highlighting where potential lanes appear and masking the rest of the image. One can simply choose to select a color that is at least as bright as a lane and ignore the rest of the image. However, what happens if lane colors differ i.e. the left lane is yellow and the right lane is white? Clearly masking in itself will fail here. Therefore, it is critical that we use Canny Edge detection. 
      </p>
      <p>However, before we can do that we must turn the image into grayscale in order detect changes in color i.e. detect an edge. Then we follow the standard procedure of applying gaussian smoothing to eliminate any potential noise. We then applied canny edge detection with a proper lower and upper bound value to get the perfect amount of edge detection without having too many false positives.

      </p>
      <h3><li>Applying Hough Transform</li></h3>
      <p>Now that we have applied Canny Edge detection, we need to use the hough transform in order to isolate the lanes. In order to do so, we create a mask over the region where the lanes would lie. We then proceed to apply the hough transform over this region and display the output.

      </p>
      <h3><li>Streamlining the Process</li></h3>
      <p>Now that we are able to detect lanes on a static image, we need to detect lanes on a video stream. In order to do so, we just have to read in the image frame by frame and put each frame into our pipeline. We then join the new images with edge detection together and get a video stream of detected lanes.

      </p>
    <h2>Problems with Current Approach</h2>
    <h2>Further Exploration</h2>
    <p>
      For this project we used python and openCV in order to process an image i.e. a frame. 
        We first worked on creating a mask to highlight where the ptential lanes are, and then used Canny Edge 
        Detection in order to make the edges apprear much more defined. We then worked on applying the Hough 
        transform in order to detect edges. Then we applied the model and test on images in our dataset.
        
        However, without using a deep learning technique, the images needs to be high contrast and low harsh weather conditions.
        Therefore, we used a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to enhance our model to detect images in any conditions.
