    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <p>
        The problem statement we are trying to solve is detecting traffic lanes in real-time. With cars being 
        driven every day and engineers trying to make cars safer, many companies are turning to machine 
        learning and self-driving in order to help solve this problem. 
    </p>

    <p>
        This is an essential problem in the real world as there are an increasing number of cars with built-in 
        technologies to do this. For example, Tesla has self-driving cars, and many other big-name automotive 
        companies have technologies such as lane assist, ensuring that the driver is driving in the correct 
        lane and direction. However, this technology is still very new and has many problems. For example, 
        how can the computer detect a lane in poor weather conditions or a faded-out lane? What if there are 
        no street lights at night that prevent the computer from detecting any lanes? What about the effects 
        of lane-like objects on the road such as railways and walkways? These variables affect every driver 
        and can affect traffic lane detection as well. While existing algorithms can have a very high 
        detection rate, generally most of these tests are done using favorable conditions such as a clear 
        road and good lighting (Huang et. al, 2021). 
    </p>

    <h2>Importance of Lane Detection</h2>
    <p>
        According to the article “Drowsy driving statistics and facts 2022” by Elizabeth Rivelli, there have 
        been over 10,000 fatal crashes due to drowsy or careless driving, including failure to keep in the 
        proper lane, being distracted (by phone, talking eating, etc), and swerving due to weather, objects, 
        etc. These serious fatalities could be easily avoided by equipping programs in modern cars with good 
        traffic lane detections that can account for any, or at least most, situations (Rivelli, 2022).
    </p>

    <h2>Motivation / Usage</h2>
    <p>
        This is an essential problem in the real world as there are an increasing number of cars with 
        built-in technologies to do this. For example, Tesla has self-driving cars, and many other big-name 
        automotive companies have technologies such as lane assist, ensuring that the driver is driving in 
        the correct lane and direction. However, this technology is very new and has many problems. For 
        example, how can the computer detect a lane in poor weather conditions or a faded-out lane? What if 
        there are no street lights at night that prevent the computer from detecting any lanes? What about 
        the effects of lane-like objects on the road such as railways and walkways? These variables affect 
        every driver and can affect traffic lane detection as well. While existing algorithms can have a very 
        high detection rate, generally most of these tests are done using favorable conditions such as a 
        clear road and good lighting.

    <h2>Current State of Art</h2>
    <p>
        <a herf="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4580573">Article</a>
        Many researchers has created high level road lane detection to account for any conditions, 
        starting with a simple similar approch as ours, and adding more layed techniques to create effective algorithms.
        For example, "Read time lane dection for autonomous vehicles" by some professors from International 
        Islamic University Malaysia.

    <h2>Dataset</h2>
    <p>
        We decided to use some of the images from the 
        <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jasonyuan000/unet-lanes-v3">UNet Lanes v3</a> dataset in 
        Kaggle. To save on computation costs, a part of this dataset is a subset of a the much larger 
        <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thomasfermi/lane-detection-for-carla-driving-simulator">
        Carla Self driving car lane</a> dataset. Additionally, images have been augmented to have dashed 
        lines labelled as mostly solid. The other part of the dataset comes from a variety of sources raning 
        from dashcam videos to images.
    </p>

    <h2>Proposed Solution</h2>
    <p>
        We decided to use some of the images from the 
        <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jasonyuan000/unet-lanes-v3">UNet Lanes v3</a> dataset in 
        Kaggle. To save on computation costs, a part of this dataset is a subset of a the much larger

            raning from dashcam videos to images.
    </p>

    <h2>Proposed Method</h2>
    <p>
        We first worked on creating a mask to highlight where the ptential lanes are, and then used Canny Edge 
        Detection in order to make the edges apprear much more defined. We then worked on applying the Hough 
        transform in order to detect edges. Then we applied the model and test on images in our dataset.
        
        However, without using a deep learning technique, the images needs to be high contrast and low harsh weather conditions.
        Therefore, we used a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to enhance our model to detect images in any conditions.
